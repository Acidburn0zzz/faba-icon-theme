###Using the Source

There are scripts to simplify the rendering process; to run them (and edit icons) you will need:

 * inkscape
 * ruby

To render new icons from their source SVG files, run the following:

    ./render-bitmaps.rb
    ./render-symbolic.rb

This script will look in the source directories (../src/*) and render the respective icons (provided there are changes).
